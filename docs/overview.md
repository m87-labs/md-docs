# Overview

Our latest model, **Moondream 3**, is a vision language model with a mixture-of-experts architecture (9B total parameters, 2B active). This model makes no compromises, delivering state-of-the-art visual reasoning while still retaining our efficient and deployment-friendly ethos.

We have 32k context window (up from 2k in previous versions) while still keeping the same fast response times from previous versions.

Moondream 3 is now the default model for our cloud API and local processing with Moondream Station.
